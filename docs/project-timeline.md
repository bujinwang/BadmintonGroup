## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Story 2.3 (Basic Pairing Algorithm)** - Complex algorithmic logic with multiple edge cases
2. **Story 3.2 (Scoring and Statistics)** - Complex data relationships and calculations
3. **Real-time Features** - Socket.IO integration across multiple components

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Story 3.1 (Session Discovery)** - Performance concerns with large datasets
2. **Story 2.1 (Permission System)** - Security implications of access control
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility** - React Native implementation challenges

### Low Risk Items
1. **Story 1.1 (Session Creation)** - Standard CRUD operations
2. **Story 1.2 (Link Joining)** - Standard user flow implementation
3. **Story 1.3 (Data Management)** - Already completed successfully

## Contingency Plans

### Schedule Slippage
- **Buffer Time:** 2 days built into each phase for unexpected issues
- **Parallel Development:** Frontend and backend can be developed somewhat independently
- **Feature Prioritization:** Less critical features can be deferred if needed

### Technical Challenges
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Fallback to simpler pairing logic if advanced algorithm proves too complex
- **Performance Issues:** Implement caching and optimization incrementally
- **Real-time Complexity:** Graceful degradation to polling if WebSocket issues arise

### Resource Constraints
- **Single Developer:** Focus on core functionality first, enhance later
- **Testing Coverage:** Automated testing prioritized over manual testing
- **Documentation:** API documentation prioritized over user documentation
