# Epic 3: Advanced Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform the badminton pairing app into a comprehensive session management platform with advanced scoring, statistics, performance optimization, and robust session discovery capabilities to support long-term user engagement and operational excellence.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Core session creation, player management, permissions, and basic pairing from Epics 1-2
- Technology stack: React Native frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL with Prisma, Socket.io for real-time, basic data models
- Integration points: Session lifecycle, player interactions, real-time communication, database operations

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Session discovery and management system, comprehensive scoring and statistics, performance optimizations, advanced testing, and production deployment capabilities
- How it integrates: Extends existing session and player models with scoring data, adds session discovery APIs, implements caching and optimization layers, enhances real-time synchronization
- Success criteria: 95%+ user retention through advanced features, <300ms response times, 99.5% uptime, comprehensive test coverage, successful production deployment

## Stories

List 1-3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 3.1:** Session Discovery and Management - Implement session search, discovery, and advanced session configuration with persistent session management
2. **Story 3.2:** Scoring and Statistics System - Add comprehensive score recording, player statistics, ranking system, and data export capabilities
3. **Story 3.3:** Performance Optimization and Production - Implement caching, database optimization, comprehensive testing, and production deployment pipeline

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing session creation and management flows continue to work unchanged
- [ ] Database schema extensions maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimizations don't break existing functionality
- [ ] New features are progressively adoptable (can be disabled if needed)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Advanced features could impact existing performance and stability
- **Mitigation:** Implement feature flags, comprehensive testing, gradual rollout
- **Rollback Plan:** New features can be disabled via configuration flags, database changes are additive

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (no regressions)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly across frontend and backend
- [ ] Documentation updated with new APIs and features
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained or improved
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed with 90%+ satisfaction score
- [ ] Production deployment successful with monitoring in place

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this advanced features epic. Key considerations:

- This builds upon the solid foundation of Epics 1-2 with core session and player management
- Integration points: Scoring system with existing player models, session discovery with existing session APIs, performance optimizations across the entire stack
- Existing patterns to follow: RESTful API design, real-time socket communication, Prisma ORM patterns, React Native component architecture
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing user flows, ensure backward compatibility, preserve real-time performance, support progressive feature adoption
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact while adding advanced capabilities

The epic should elevate the app from MVP to a production-ready platform with enterprise-grade features and performance."
