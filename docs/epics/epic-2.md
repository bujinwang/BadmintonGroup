# Epic 2: Basic Management Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Establish core management capabilities for badminton sessions, including permission controls, player status management, and basic pairing functionality to support organized gameplay and smooth session administration.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Basic session creation, joining, and data management from Epic 1
- Technology stack: React Native frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL with Prisma, Socket.io for real-time
- Integration points: Session management APIs, real-time communication, database models

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Permission system for session organizers vs players, player status controls (rest/pause, leave), basic pairing algorithm for fair gameplay
- How it integrates: Extends existing session and player models, adds permission middleware, enhances real-time communication for status updates
- Success criteria: 95%+ permission enforcement accuracy, 90%+ successful status change operations, 85%+ user satisfaction with pairing fairness

## Stories

List 1-3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 2.1:** Permission System Implementation - Implement role-based access control distinguishing session organizers from regular players with appropriate UI controls
2. **Story 2.2:** Player Status Management - Add "rest" (歇一下) and "leave" (离场) functionality with approval workflows and real-time status updates
3. **Story 2.3:** Basic Pairing Algorithm - Implement fair pairing logic based on player skills and participation history for optimal gameplay

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing session creation and joining flows continue to work unchanged
- [ ] Database schema extensions are backward compatible
- [ ] Real-time communication maintains existing performance levels
- [ ] UI changes follow established design patterns and accessibility standards

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Permission system complexity could impact existing user flows
- **Mitigation:** Implement gradual rollout with feature flags and comprehensive testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Permission checks can be disabled by removing middleware, status features can be hidden via UI flags

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (no regressions)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly across frontend and backend
- [ ] Documentation updated with new APIs and permission rules
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed with 85%+ satisfaction score
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained (response times <500ms)

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to existing session management system with Node.js/Express backend and React Native frontend
- Integration points: Permission middleware, player status APIs, pairing algorithm integration
- Existing patterns to follow: RESTful API design, real-time socket communication, Prisma ORM patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing user flows, ensure backward compatibility, preserve real-time performance
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should establish solid management foundations while maintaining the simplicity of the MVP approach."
