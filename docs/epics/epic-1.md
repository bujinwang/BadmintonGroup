# Epic 1: First Version Core Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Deliver the core MVP functionality for the badminton pairing management app, enabling users to create sessions, share via links, and join without authentication. This establishes the foundation for the intelligent pairing system while maintaining simplicity for the initial release.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Basic backend infrastructure with Node.js/Express server, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM, and React Native mobile frontend
- Technology stack: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, React Native, Socket.io for real-time features
- Integration points: Backend API endpoints, database models, frontend navigation and state management

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: No-authentication session creation, shareable link generation, link-based joining mechanism, and simplified data management for sessions and players
- How it integrates: Builds upon existing backend architecture by adding new API routes, extends frontend with new screens and components, maintains existing database schema patterns
- Success criteria: 95%+ user success rate in creating sessions within 2 minutes, 99%+ link generation and sharing functionality, 90%+ successful joins via shared links

## Stories

List 1-3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 1:** Session Creation and Sharing - Implement no-authentication session creation interface with automatic shareable link generation and multi-platform sharing support (WeChat/WhatsApp)
2. **Story 2:** Link Joining Functionality - Create link parsing and joining flow where users can enter their name to join sessions without account registration
3. **Story 3:** Basic Data Management - Establish simplified session and player data structures with essential API endpoints for CRUD operations

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (first version implementation)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible with future authentication features
- [ ] UI changes follow existing React Native component patterns and design system
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal with response times under 500ms for core operations

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Integration complexity between new features and existing backend infrastructure
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive API testing and gradual feature rollout with feature flags
- **Rollback Plan:** New features can be disabled by removing API routes and frontend navigation entries

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (no regressions)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly across backend and frontend
- [ ] Documentation updated with new API endpoints and data models
- [ ] No regression in existing features with performance benchmarks maintained

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL and React Native frontend
- Integration points: Backend API routes, database models, frontend navigation and state management
- Existing patterns to follow: RESTful API design, Prisma ORM patterns, React Native component structure
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing API contracts, ensure backward compatibility, follow established UI patterns
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering the core MVP value of simplified session management without authentication."
