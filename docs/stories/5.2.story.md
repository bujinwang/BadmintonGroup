# Story 5.2: Player Performance Tracking

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a player,
I want to track my performance over time,
So that I can monitor improvement and set personal goals.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/epics/epic-5.md (Analytics and Insights Dashboard)
- Enhancement Type: Personal performance analytics
- Existing System Impact: Extends player profiles with performance tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Personal win/loss statistics with detailed breakdowns
2. Skill level progression tracking over time
3. Match history with opponent details and scores
4. Performance trends and improvement metrics
5. Comparison with players of similar skill levels
6. Achievement badges and milestone tracking
7. Personal best records and statistics
8. Goal setting and progress tracking

**Integration Requirements:**

9. Integration with existing match and scoring systems
10. Real-time performance updates after matches
11. Privacy controls for performance data sharing
12. Historical data migration and accuracy
13. Performance data export for personal records
14. Cross-platform synchronization

**Quality Requirements:**

15. Performance data accuracy > 99%
16. Real-time updates within 30 seconds of match completion
17. Mobile-optimized performance views
18. Intuitive progress visualization
19. Data backup and recovery
20. Performance calculation audit trail

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

21. Privacy-first design with granular sharing controls
22. Scalable performance tracking for large player bases
23. Responsive design for all device sizes
24. Accessibility compliant performance displays

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

Builds on MVP scoring and player systems. Requires performance calculation infrastructure.

### Integration Approach

Extend Player model with performance metrics, add performance calculation service, create personal dashboard UI.

### Technical Constraints

- Privacy: User controls over performance data visibility
- Performance: Efficient calculations for real-time updates
- Accuracy: Precise win/loss and skill calculations
- Scalability: Handle performance tracking for thousands of players

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design performance data models
  - [ ] Extend Player model with performance metrics
  - [ ] Create PerformanceRecord model for historical data
  - [ ] Add Achievement model for badges/milestones
  - [ ] Update Prisma schema

- [ ] Task 2: Implement performance calculation service
  - [ ] Win/loss ratio calculations
  - [ ] Skill level progression algorithms
  - [ ] Performance trend analysis
  - [ ] Achievement detection logic

- [ ] Task 3: Build performance API
  - [ ] GET /api/performance/{playerId} endpoint
  - [ ] GET /api/performance/trends endpoint
  - [ ] POST /api/performance/goals endpoint
  - [ ] Real-time performance updates

- [ ] Task 4: Create performance dashboard UI
  - [ ] PerformanceDashboardScreen component
  - [ ] Progress charts and trend visualizations
  - [ ] Achievement badge display
  - [ ] Goal setting and tracking interface

- [ ] Task 5: Add performance testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for calculation algorithms
  - [ ] Integration tests with match data
  - [ ] Performance benchmark tests
  - [ ] Privacy and accuracy validation tests

## Testing

### Validation Steps

1. Create sample match data and verify performance calculations
2. Test skill level progression with multiple matches
3. Verify achievement detection and badge awarding
4. Check privacy controls for performance data
5. Validate trend analysis and progress tracking
6. Test goal setting and progress monitoring

### Test Scenarios

- Performance calculation accuracy
- Skill progression algorithms
- Achievement system functionality
- Privacy control effectiveness
- Real-time update performance
- Data export and backup

### File Structure Impact

New files:
- backend/src/services/performanceService.ts
- backend/src/routes/performance.ts
- frontend/src/components/PerformanceDashboardScreen.tsx
- frontend/src/components/ProgressChart.tsx

Modified files:
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma

### Data Models

```prisma
model Player {
  // ... existing fields
  skillLevel     Float?    @default(0)
  totalMatches   Int       @default(0)
  wins           Int       @default(0)
  losses         Int       @default(0)
  performanceRecords PerformanceRecord[]
  achievements   Achievement[]
}

model PerformanceRecord {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  playerId    String
  matchId     String?
  skillChange Float
  newSkillLevel Float
  timestamp   DateTime @default(now())

  player Player @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
}

model Achievement {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  playerId    String
  type        String   // "first_win", "skill_milestone", etc.
  title       String
  description String
  earnedAt    DateTime @default(now())

  player Player @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Contracts

Get Player Performance:
```json
GET /api/performance/{playerId}
{
  "currentStats": {
    "skillLevel": 3.2,
    "winRate": 0.65,
    "totalMatches": 47,
    "currentStreak": 3
  },
  "trends": [...],
  "achievements": [...],
  "recentMatches": [...]
}
```
