  analytics     TournamentAnalytics?
  feedback      TournamentFeedback[]
}

model TournamentAnalytics {
  id                    String   @id @default(cuid())
  tournamentId          String   @unique
  totalParticipants     Int

}

model TournamentFeedback {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  tournamentId String
  playerId     String
  rating       Int      // 1-5 scale
  comments     String?
  submittedAt  DateTime @default(now())

  tournament Tournament @relation(fields: [tournamentId], references: [id])
  player     Player    @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
}
```
