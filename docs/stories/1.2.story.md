# Story 1.2: Link Joining Functionality - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Done

## Story

As a badminton player,
I want to join a session by clicking a shared link and entering my name,
So that I can participate in the game without creating an account.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd.md (Phase 1 MVP requirements)
- Enhancement Type: New feature implementation
- Existing System Impact: Adds new join flow to existing system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Link Parsing**: System correctly parses share links in format `/join/{sessionId}` from any source (WeChat, WhatsApp, browser)
2. **Session Validation**: System validates session exists, is active, and has available spots before allowing join
3. **Join Screen Display**: User sees session details (name, location, time, current players) on join screen
4. **Name Input**: User can enter their name (required, 2-30 characters, validated for appropriateness)
5. **Join Confirmation**: System successfully adds user to session and shows confirmation
6. **Real-time Updates**: Other participants see new joiner in real-time via existing socket connection
7. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid links, full sessions, expired sessions

**Integration Requirements:**

8. **Navigation Flow**: Join flow integrates seamlessly with existing app navigation
9. **Data Consistency**: Join operation maintains data integrity with existing session management
10. **Socket Integration**: Uses existing real-time infrastructure for live updates
11. **API Compatibility**: Join endpoint follows existing API patterns and error handling

**Quality Requirements:**

12. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation prevents inappropriate names and duplicate joins
13. **Security**: Link validation prevents unauthorized access to session details
14. **Performance**: Join operation completes within 1 second under normal conditions
15. **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when network unavailable
16. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for link parsing, integration tests for join flow

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

17. **Accessibility**: Join screen supports screen readers and keyboard navigation
18. **Cross-Platform**: Identical behavior on iOS and Android devices
19. **Internationalization**: Support for Chinese characters in names (WeChat integration)
20. **Privacy**: User names are displayed but not stored permanently without consent

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

Current system has session management with real-time updates via Socket.io. Existing patterns include API service layer, navigation stack, and form validation components.

### Integration Approach

Add JoinSessionScreen to navigation, create GET /api/sessions/{id} for session details, POST /api/sessions/{id}/join for joining. Integrate with existing socket events for real-time updates.

### Technical Constraints

- Link format must match creation: /join/{sessionId}
- Session validation required before showing join screen
- Real-time updates must use existing socket infrastructure
- Name validation should prevent inappropriate content

### Missing Information

- Exact link domain and routing configuration
- Session capacity validation rules
- Real-time event names for joins
- Name validation rules and inappropriate content detection

  - [x] Validate sessionId format before API calls

- [x] Task 2: Create session details API endpoint
  - [x] Add GET /api/sessions/{id} endpoint
  - [x] Return session details for valid, active sessions
  - [x] Include current player count and capacity

- [x] Task 3: Build join screen UI

  - [x] Create POST /api/sessions/{id}/join endpoint
  - [x] Add player to session with name validation
  - [x] Emit socket event for real-time updates
  - [x] Return success confirmation

- [x] Task 5: Add error handling and validation
  - [x] Handle invalid session IDs
  - [x] Handle full sessions
  - [x] Handle expired/inactive sessions
  - [x] Add client-side and server-side validation

- [x] Task 6: Integrate real-time updates
  - [x] Listen for join events on session screen
  - [x] Update player list in real-time
  - [x] Handle connection errors gracefully

- [x] Task 7: Add tests
  - [x] Unit tests for link parsing and validation
  - [x] Integration tests for join flow
  - [x] UI tests for join screen interactions

## Testing

### Validation Steps

1. Generate valid share link from Story 1.1
2. Click link and verify correct session details load
3. Enter valid name and join successfully
4. Verify real-time update on other devices
5. Test error cases: invalid link, full session, invalid name
6. Verify navigation back to main app after joining

### Test Scenarios

- Valid join with available spots
- Join attempt on full session
- Invalid session ID handling
- Network failure during join
- Real-time updates across multiple devices
- Name validation (length, characters, duplicates)
