# Story 1.1: Session Creation and Sharing - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Done

## Story

As a badminton group organizer,
I want to create a session without logging in and get a shareable link,
So that I can quickly invite players to join via WeChat or WhatsApp.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd.md (Phase 1 MVP requirements)
- Enhancement Type: New feature implementation
- Existing System Impact: Adds new screen and API endpoint to existing system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Session Creation Access**: User can navigate to session creation screen from main menu without requiring authentication
2. **Session Details Input**: User can enter all required session details:
   - Session name (required, 3-50 characters)
   - Location (required, text field)
   - Date and time (required, future date only)
   - Maximum players (required, 2-20 range)
   - Organizer name (required, 2-30 characters)
3. **Input Validation**: System validates all inputs with clear error messages:
   - Required fields cannot be empty
   - Session name must be unique for the organizer
   - Date/time must be in the future
   - Max players must be reasonable (2-20)
4. **Session Creation**: System successfully creates session in database with all provided details
5. **Share Link Generation**: System generates unique, trackable share link in format `/join/{sessionId}`
6. **Native Sharing**: Share link supports native device sharing to:
   - WeChat (if available)
   - WhatsApp (if available)
   - Other messaging apps via system share sheet
7. **Success Feedback**: User receives clear confirmation of successful creation with share options

**Integration Requirements:**

8. **Navigation Compatibility**: Existing navigation patterns and screens continue to work unchanged
9. **Component Patterns**: New screen follows existing React Native component patterns and design system
10. **API Integration**: Backend session creation API maintains existing error handling and response formats
11. **Share Integration**: Uses React Native Share API with proper error handling for unavailable apps

**Quality Requirements:**

12. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for form validation, API integration tests for session creation, UI tests for share functionality
13. **API Documentation**: New POST /api/sessions endpoint is documented with request/response examples
14. **Regression Testing**: Existing functionality verified through automated tests and manual verification
15. **Performance**: Session creation completes within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
16. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network failures, invalid inputs, and share failures

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

17. **Accessibility**: Screen is usable with screen readers and supports keyboard navigation
18. **Cross-Platform**: Functionality works identically on iOS and Android devices
19. **Offline Handling**: Clear error message if network unavailable during creation
20. **Security**: Share links are not guessable and expire appropriately

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

[Extract from available documentation]

Current system has basic session management with backend API routes and React Native frontend screens. Existing patterns include RESTful API calls through service layers and screen navigation using React Navigation.

### Integration Approach

Add new CreateSessionScreen to navigation stack, create POST /sessions endpoint, integrate React Native Share API for link sharing. Follow existing sessionApi service pattern for API calls.

### Technical Constraints

- No user authentication required for session creation
- Shareable links must be unique and trackable
- Must work on both iOS and Android platforms
- Link format: /join/{sessionId}

### Missing Information

- Exact share link format and domain configuration
- Specific validation rules for session creation
- Error handling patterns for failed creations

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create session creation API endpoint
  - [x] Add POST /sessions route to backend
  - [x] Implement session creation logic with validation
  - [x] Generate unique shareable link
  - [x] Return session data with share link

- [x] Task 2: Create session creation screen
  - [x] Add CreateSessionScreen component
  - [x] Implement form with session details inputs
  - [x] Add form validation
  - [x] Integrate with session creation API

- [x] Task 3: Implement share functionality
  - [x] Add share button to creation success screen
  - [x] Integrate React Native Share API
  - [x] Support WeChat and WhatsApp sharing
  - [x] Handle share success/failure states

- [x] Task 4: Update navigation
  - [x] Add CreateSessionScreen to navigation stack
  - [x] Update main menu to include create session option
  - [x] Test navigation flow

- [x] Task 5: Add tests
  - [x] Unit tests for API endpoint
  - [x] Integration tests for session creation flow
  - [x] UI tests for share functionality

## Testing

### Validation Steps

1. Navigate to create session screen without authentication
2. Enter valid session details and submit
3. Verify session created in database with correct data
4. Verify shareable link generated and functional
5. Test sharing to WeChat and WhatsApp
6. Verify existing navigation and functionality unchanged

### Test Scenarios

- Valid session creation with all fields
- Invalid input validation (missing required fields)
- Share link generation and functionality
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Error handling for API failures

## Dev Notes

### File Structure Impact

New files to be created:
- frontend/BadmintonGroup/src/screens/CreateSessionScreen.tsx
- backend/src/routes/sessions.ts (if not exists, extend existing)

Modified files:
- frontend/BadmintonGroup/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
- backend/src/routes/index.ts

### API Contract

POST /api/sessions
Request:
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "location": "string",
  "dateTime": "ISO string",
  "maxPlayers": "number",
  "organizerName": "string"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "session": { ... },
  "shareLink": "https://app.domain/join/{sessionId}"
}
```

### UI Requirements

- Clean, simple form layout following existing design patterns
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Success state with share options
- Loading states for API calls
- Error handling with retry options

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk Assessment

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** New API endpoint conflicts with existing routes
- **Mitigation:** Thorough API testing and gradual rollout
- **Rollback:** Remove new route and revert navigation changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible
