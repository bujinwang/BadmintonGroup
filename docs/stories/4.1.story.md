### Data Models

```prisma
model Tournament {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  format    String   // "single_elimination", "round_robin"
  status    String   // "registration", "in_progress", "completed"
  organizer String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  brackets Bracket[]
  players  TournamentPlayer[]
}

model Bracket {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  tournamentId String
  round       Int
  matchNumber Int
  player1Id   String?
  player2Id   String?
  winnerId    String?
  status      String    // "scheduled", "completed"

  tournament Tournament @relation(fields: [tournamentId], references: [id])
}

model TournamentPlayer {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  tournamentId String
  playerId    String
  seed        Int?

  tournament Tournament @relation(fields: [tournamentId], references: [id])
  player     Player     @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Contracts

Create Tournament:
```json
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "name": "Weekly Singles Tournament",
  "format": "single_elimination",
  "maxPlayers": 16
}
```

Get Tournament Bracket:
```json
GET /api/tournaments/{id}/bracket
{
  "rounds": [...],
  "matches": [...]
}
```
