}
```

### API Contracts

Record Match:
```json
POST /api/matches
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "player1Id": "string",
  "player2Id": "string",
  "winnerId": "string",
  "scoreType": "2-0" | "2-1"
}
```

Get Player Statistics:
```json
GET /api/players/{id}/statistics
{
  "totalMatches": 25,
  "wins": 18,
  "losses": 7,
  "winRate": 0.72,
  "ranking": 3,
  "rankingPoints": 1250,
  "recentMatches": [...]
}
```

### Statistics Calculations

**Win Rate:** wins / totalMatches
**Ranking Points:** Based on opponent strength and recency
**Ranking:** Position based on ranking points
**Performance Metrics:** Average points per game, consistency score

### Real-time Events

```typescript
// Match recorded
socket.emit('match_recorded', {
  matchId: string,
  sessionId: string,
  winnerId: string,
  statistics: object
});

// Statistics updated
socket.emit('statistics_updated', {
  playerId: string,
  newStatistics: object
});
```
