## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD (Significantly Improved)**

The AI pairing system now features a comprehensive test suite addressing previous testing gaps, with strong algorithm implementation, efficient caching, and solid privacy practices. Backend services maintain good TypeScript typing and async patterns. API routes have appropriate validation and role-based access. However, key acceptance criteria for advanced features (group pairings, permissions, backup, audit, bias) remain unimplemented, and security enhancements are needed for production.

**Strengths:**
- Full test suite (100+ cases) validates algorithms, performance (<2s for 50+ players), privacy (no PII in history), and error handling
- Efficient parallel scoring with Promise.all and caching (5-min TTL)
- Clean AI service isolation from routes
- Feedback loop for model improvement

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No support for group/team events (AC7)
- Route-level permissions only; no player opt-out (AC11)
- No backup/recovery for model params (AC19)
- Console.log audit; needs structured logging (AC20)
- No bias detection/mitigation (AC24)

### Refactoring Performed

None; focused on re-assessment post-test implementation. Recommend dev implement remaining ACs.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript and patterns followed
- Project Structure: ✓ AI integrated properly with pairings routes
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Fully implemented with >90% coverage
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ 20/24 (tests cover core; gaps in 7,11,19,20,24)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Full test suite implemented (100+ cases)
- [ ] Group/team pairing support (AC7)
- [ ] Player-level AI permissions/opt-out (AC11)
- [ ] AI model backup system (AC19)
- [ ] Structured audit trail (AC20)
- [ ] Bias mitigation algorithms (AC24)
- [ ] Encrypt model params; add AI rate limiting

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- Role checks on routes (OWNER/ORGANIZER)
- No PII in PairingHistory
- Basic input validation

**Concerns:**
- Model params unencrypted in DB
- No AI-specific rate limiting (DoS risk)
- No player AI opt-out control

**Recommendations:**
- Encrypt AIModelParameters in DB
- Rate limit /suggest endpoint
- Add opt-out in player preferences

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Tests confirm <2s for large sets
- Caching reduces DB hits
- Async processing

**Recommendations:**
- Add metrics for cache hit rates
- Monitor in production
