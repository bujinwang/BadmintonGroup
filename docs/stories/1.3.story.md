# Story 1.3: Basic Data Management - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Done

## Story

As a system administrator,
I want simplified data structures for sessions and players with basic CRUD operations,
So that the MVP can store and retrieve session and player information reliably.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd.md (Phase 1 MVP data model requirements)
- Enhancement Type: Foundation infrastructure
- Existing System Impact: Establishes data layer for the entire MVP

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Session Data Model**: Complete session entity with all required fields (id, name, location, dateTime, maxPlayers, organizerName, status)
2. **Player Data Model**: Player entity with session relationship (id, name, sessionId, joinedAt)
3. **Database Schema**: Prisma schema created and migrated for sessions and players tables
4. **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for both entities
5. **Data Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between sessions and players
6. **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all required fields and data types
7. **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for session and player management

**Integration Requirements:**

8. **Existing Database**: Integrates with existing PostgreSQL database and Prisma setup
9. **API Patterns**: Follows existing API route patterns and error handling
10. **Migration Safety**: Database migrations are backward compatible
11. **Connection Handling**: Proper database connection management and error handling

**Quality Requirements:**

12. **Data Integrity**: Referential integrity maintained between sessions and players
13. **Performance**: Query performance optimized for MVP usage patterns
14. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database operations
15. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for data models, integration tests for database operations
16. **Documentation**: API endpoints documented with examples

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

17. **Scalability**: Schema supports future MVP enhancements without major changes
18. **Security**: Basic input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
19. **Monitoring**: Database query logging for debugging and performance monitoring
20. **Backup**: Data structure supports existing backup and recovery processes

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

Current system uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Existing patterns include migration-based schema updates and service layer architecture.

### Integration Approach

Extend existing Prisma schema with session and player models. Create new API routes following existing patterns. Ensure migrations are safe and reversible.

### Technical Constraints

- Must use existing Prisma/PostgreSQL setup
- Schema must support MVP requirements without over-engineering
- API endpoints must follow REST conventions
- Data validation must be comprehensive but not overly complex

### Missing Information

- Exact field types and constraints for MVP
- Indexing strategy for performance
- Migration rollback procedures
- Data seeding requirements for testing

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design data models
  - [ ] Define Session model with all required fields
  - [ ] Define Player model with session relationship
  - [ ] Establish proper foreign key constraints
  - [ ] Add indexes for performance

- [ ] Task 2: Create Prisma schema
  - [ ] Update schema.prisma with new models
  - [ ] Add relationships and constraints
  - [ ] Include data validation rules
  - [ ] Generate and run migration

- [ ] Task 3: Implement session CRUD operations
  - [ ] Create session service methods
  - [ ] Add session API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - [ ] Implement input validation
  - [ ] Add error handling

- [ ] Task 4: Implement player CRUD operations
  - [ ] Create player service methods
  - [ ] Add player API routes

  - [ ] Add validation for player operations

- [ ] Task 5: Add data validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Server-side validation for all inputs
  - [ ] SQL injection prevention

- [ ] Task 7: Add tests and documentation
  - [ ] Unit tests for data models
  - [ ] Integration tests for database operations
  - [ ] API documentation with examples
  - [ ] Data seeding scripts for testing

## Testing

### Validation Steps

1. Run Prisma migration successfully
2. Create test session via API
3. Add players to session via API
4. Retrieve session with players
5. Update session details
6. Delete session and verify cascade
7. Test validation errors for invalid inputs
8. Verify database constraints work correctly

### Test Scenarios

- Valid session creation with all fields
- Player joining with valid session ID
- Invalid input validation (missing fields, wrong types)
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Database connection failures
- Concurrent operations on same session

## Dev Notes

### File Structure Impact

New files to be created:
- backend/src/models/Session.ts (if needed)
- backend/src/models/Player.ts (if needed)
- backend/src/services/sessionService.ts
- backend/src/services/playerService.ts
- backend/src/routes/sessions.ts
- backend/src/routes/players.ts

Modified files:
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma
- backend/src/routes/index.ts
- backend/src/services/index.ts

### Database Schema

Session model:
```prisma
model Session {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  location    String
  dateTime    DateTime
  maxPlayers  Int
  organizerName String
  status      String   @default("active")
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  players     Player[]
}
```

Player model:
```prisma
model Player {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  sessionId String
  joinedAt  DateTime @default(now())

  session   Session  @relation(fields: [sessionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### API Contracts

Sessions:
- GET /api/sessions - List sessions
- GET /api/sessions/:id - Get session with players
- POST /api/sessions - Create session
- PUT /api/sessions/:id - Update session
- DELETE /api/sessions/:id - Delete session

Players:
- GET /api/sessions/:id/players - Get session players
- POST /api/sessions/:id/players - Add player to session
- DELETE /api/sessions/:id/players/:playerId - Remove player

### Migration Strategy

- Create initial migration for new tables
- Ensure rollback capability
- Test migration on development database
- Document migration steps for production
