## Dev Notes

### File Structure Impact

New files to be created:
- backend/src/middleware/caching.ts
- backend/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts
- backend/src/services/cacheService.ts
- backend/src/services/monitoringService.ts
- docker/production.Dockerfile
- docker/docker-compose.prod.yml
- scripts/deploy.sh
- tests/load/
- tests/integration/

Modified files:
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma
- backend/src/config/database.ts
- frontend/metro.config.js
- frontend/app.json
- package.json (root and backend)

### Performance Targets

**Database:**
- Query response time: <100ms for 95th percentile
- Connection pool utilization: <80%
- Cache hit rate: >90% for frequently accessed data

**API:**
- Average response time: <200ms
- 95th percentile: <500ms
- Error rate: <1%

**Frontend:**
- App startup time: <3 seconds
- Navigation transitions: <300ms
- Bundle size: <5MB for initial load

### Caching Strategy

**Redis Cache Keys:**
- `session:{id}` - Session data with 5min TTL
- `player:{id}` - Player data with 10min TTL
- `discovery:{params}` - Discovery results with 2min TTL
- `statistics:{playerId}` - Statistics with 1min TTL

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Session updates invalidate related caches
- Player changes invalidate player and session caches
- Time-based expiration for discovery results

### Monitoring Setup

**Application Metrics:**
- Response times by endpoint
- Error rates and types
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss rates
- User session duration

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O
- Database connections
- Redis memory usage

**Business Metrics:**
- Active sessions
- User engagement
- Feature usage
- Performance by region

### Deployment Pipeline

**Stages:**
1. **Build**: Compile and test all components
2. **Staging**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Integration Tests**: Run full test suite
4. **Load Tests**: Performance validation
5. **Production**: Blue-green deployment
6. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment validation

### Security Hardening
